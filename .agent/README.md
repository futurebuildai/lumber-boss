# Agent Collaboration Docs

This folder contains documentation for AI agents working on the Lumber Boss project.

## Purpose

Store collaborative markdown documents that:
- Persist context between agent sessions
- Document decisions, rationale, and trade-offs
- Track open questions and TODOs
- Provide onboarding context for new agents

## Key Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) | Project context, goals, and background |
| [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) | Architecture and design decisions log |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Feature roadmap and priorities |

## For Agents

When starting work:
1. Read this README first
2. Review CONTEXT.md for project understanding
3. Check ROADMAP.md for current priorities
4. Log any significant decisions in DECISIONS.md

When completing work:
1. Update relevant docs with new learnings
2. Add new TODOs or open questions
3. Document any deferred work
